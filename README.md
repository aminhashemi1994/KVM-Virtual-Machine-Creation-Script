# KVM-Virtual-Machine-Creation-Script
This repository contains a script for automating KVM virtual machine creation using cloud-ready qcow2 images (Debian or Ubuntu). Users can configure CPU, memory, disk size, IP, and network settings. The script uses cloud-init for automatic setup. Future updates will improve automation and handling of tasks like image downloads.
